# QA_task
ManualTestCases.docx is the first part of the assessment. I created one full test case just for example how I would write it, and the rest of possible variations are in the table.

Adaptavist.postman_collection.json is a file that consists of 3 requests. After sending the requests, I used "Generate Tests" option since it's my first time using Postman.

In the Playwright file I created 6 test cases that are covering the ManualTestCases.docx (Sign In scenarios). I used the "npx playwright codegen https://magento.softwaretestingboard.com" command to write test cases since it's my first time working with Playwright.
